    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lentil soup is a hearty and nutritious soup made from lentils, vegetables,
      and sometimes meat or poultry. The lentils are typically simmered in a
      flavorful broth with onions, carrots, celery, garlic, and other herbs and
      spices to create a rich and savory soup that is both satisfying and
      comforting.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup dried brown or green lentils, rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2-3 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
      <li>2-3 stalks of celery, chopped</li>
      <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>4 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 can diced tomatoes (14.5 oz)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>In order to prepare the meal, follow these instructions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion,
        carrots, celery, and garlic, and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring
        occasionally, until the vegetables are softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the lentils, broth, water, diced tomatoes, thyme, rosemary, bay
        leaves, salt, and black pepper to the pot. Stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer
        for 30-40 minutes, or until the lentils are tender and the soup is
        thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the bay leaves from the soup and taste for seasoning, adding more
        salt or pepper as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the soup hot, garnished with chopped fresh herbs or a drizzle of
        olive oil, if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
