      your favorite ice cream flavor sandwiched between soft and fluffy brioche
      buns. The ice cream balls are lightly browned in a skillet, creating a
      warm and gooey center. A drizzle of melted chocolate and peanut butter

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Here you have a list of the ingredients you'll need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 brioche buns</li>
      <li>4 scoops of your favorite ice cream flavor</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1/4 cup peanut butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>In order to prepare the meal, follow these instructions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Begin by preparing the ice cream. Using an ice cream scoop, form four
        equal-sized balls of ice cream and place them on a baking sheet lined
        with parchment paper. Freeze for at least 30 minutes or until firm.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small saucepan, melt the chocolate chips and peanut butter together
        over low heat. Stir frequently until smooth and well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Split the brioche buns in half and lightly toast them under the broiler
        or in a toaster oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, melt the unsalted butter over medium heat. Place the
        frozen ice cream balls in the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes on each
        side, or until lightly browned and heated through.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble the burgers, place the bottom halves of the brioche buns on
        a plate. Place one ice cream ball on top of each bun half. Drizzle the
        melted chocolate and peanut butter mixture over the ice cream. Add the
        top halves of the brioche buns to create a "burger" shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious and unique ice cream burger!
      </li>
    </ol>
